        Many people use the terms<strong> Internet</strong> and the<strong> World Wide Web</strong> interchangeably.
        but in fact, <br> the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two<br>
        separated but related things.

      <br><br>
      
        The <strong>Internet</strong> is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It<br>
        connects millions of computers together globally, forming a network in which<br>
        any computer can communicate with other computers as long as they are both<br>
        connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of<br>
        anguages called <i>"Protocols"</i>.
      
      <br><br>
      

        The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> or simply <i>"Web"</i>, is a way of accessing information over<br>
        me medium of the internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top<br>
        fthe internet. The Web uses the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong>, only one of the languages<br>
        poken over the internet, to transmit data.
